# learning-jenga

In this Unity project demo, I've created a 3D Jenga game that represents educational concepts using data from an API. The game features three block types: Glass, Wood, and Stone, symbolizing concepts that need to be learned, concepts that were learned but not tested, and concepts that were tested and mastered. The game also has a "Test my Stack" mode where players can eliminate Glass blocks and test the physics of their stack.

The game separates "data" and "gameplay" elements using two interfaces to communicate and a barebones dependency injection container. 

The project took a little bit over seven hours to create.
